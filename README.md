# SimPool - Web-Based Billiards Simulator

A lightweight web-based billiards (pool) simulator built with TypeScript and HTML Canvas. This project implements basic 2D physics for ball movement and collisions, focusing on a clean, simple implementation without spin mechanics.

## Features

- ðŸŽ± Realistic ball physics with elastic collisions
- ðŸŽ¯ Click-and-drag cue aiming system
- ðŸŽ¨ Clean, modern UI with HTML Canvas rendering
- ðŸ“Š Basic scoring and shot tracking
- ðŸŽ® Simple controls for an intuitive gaming experience

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript + HTML Canvas
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Physics**: Custom 2D vector math implementation
- **Framework**: Vanilla TypeScript (no framework dependencies)

## Core Implementation

The simulator implements the following key components:

1. **Ball Physics**

   - Position and velocity vectors
   - Elastic collisions between balls
   - Wall boundary collisions
   - Friction/damping simulation

2. **Game Mechanics**

   - Cue ball control with power-based shooting
   - Pocket detection
   - Basic scoring system

3. **Rendering**
   - Canvas-based graphics
   - Smooth animation using requestAnimationFrame
   - Visual feedback for aiming and power

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simpool.git
   cd simpool
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is configured for deployment to GitHub Pages. Here's what you need to know:

### Development Rules

1. **No Server-Side Code**: This project is designed to run entirely in the browser. Do not add server-side dependencies or code.
2. **Static Assets**: All assets (images, sounds, etc.) should be stored in the `public` directory.
3. **API Calls**: If you need to make API calls, use browser-compatible fetch or axios, and ensure the API endpoints are CORS-enabled.
4. **State Management**: Use client-side state management (React state, context, or local storage) for data persistence.

### Deployment

The project automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to the main branch. The deployment process:

1. Builds the project using `npm run build`
2. Deploys the contents of the `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch
3. Makes the site available at `https://[your-username].github.io/simpool`

### Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Local Development

```bash
npm run dev     # Start development server
npm run build   # Build for production
npm run preview # Preview production build
```
